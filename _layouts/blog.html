      <p>Interaction with the digital world will not be limited to flat screens forever and the shift towards immersive spatial interfaces is well underway. The release of the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive in 2016, kicked-off a new era for virtual reality (VR), and despite diminished public enthusiasm or market momentum, <strong>VR is the best it has ever been with the most advanced headsets and compelling content to date.</strong></p>
      <p>With rising competition between tech giants like Meta and Apple, and the emergence of practical use cases for XR, <strong>we believe the time to build is now.</strong></p>
      <p>To fully realize the potential of VR, high-quality and valuable applications are required, which is why we are excited to announce the launch of <span style="color:#9065b0;">△</span> <strong>Syry</strong>, a company focused on <strong>unlocking the potential of virtual reality at the intersection of gaming and education.</strong></p>

      <div class="gradient-header"></div>
      <br>
      <p>While the possibilities for XR are endless, Syry is focusing on two areas where we have gathered deep expertise and have had impact over the last seven years:</p>
      <h2 style="text-align: center;">Syry <span style="color:#9065b0; font-style: italic;">Games</span></h2>
      <p>
        With an estimated install base of
        <a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/ndreams-vr-growth-patrick-oluanaigh-interview/" style="text-decoration: none;">
          <strong>40 million VR headsets</strong>
        </a>, Meta Quest Store games
        <a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/quest-2-revenue-games-apps-gdc-2023/" style="text-decoration: none;">
          <strong>reaching $10M in revenue</strong>
        </a>, and plenty of room for innovation, gaming is full of opportunity.
        <strong>Focusing on the unique value virtual reality can offer,</strong> we are hand-crafting engaging VR games where responsive interaction with the virtual realm is paramount. To kickstart our journey, we’ve released
        <a href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/6715799361775532/" style="text-decoration: none;">
          <strong>Whaacky Walls!</strong>
        </a>, a simple yet engaging game where players move to fit into incoming walls and currently developing a unique title <em>we can’t wait to share</em>.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2 style="text-align: center;">Syry <span style="color:#9065b0; font-style: italic;">Education</span></h2>
      <p>
        We’ve experienced first-hand the impact VR is having across enterprise training and higher education in a variety of verticals, ranging from high-risk training in the mining industry and heavy machinery simulations to soft skills training and history lessons.
        <strong>VR is providing great value in terms of learning speed, retention, and motivation</strong>. Throughout this process, we discovered that content creation is currently the biggest hurdle due to its cost, complexity, and time to develop. To solve this,
        <strong>we have built the ultimate VR content creation tool</strong>, as simple as recording yourself. Our vision is simple:
        <strong>instant and infinite immersive education for all</strong>. We are currently running our first pilots with excellent feedback and will be generally available soon!

      <h2 style="text-align: center;">Experienced team building for XR</h2>
      <div class="gradient-header"></div>
      <br>
      <p>For the past seven years, our team has been dedicated to creating immersive experiences ranging from training and simulation to narrative-driven experiences. <strong>With over 50 projects completed for Fortune 500 companies</strong>, we have established ourselves in the field and are eager to expand.</p>
      <p>Nonetheless, this is an ambitious project, and <strong>we’re recruiting fellow designers and engineers to join us!</strong> We believe that small teams with a high level of trust, ownership, and passion can have a huge impact.</p>
      <br>
      <p>This only marks the beginning, and we're eager to share use cases, insights, and our progress on making gaming and education fully immersive. Join us on our journey, and if you're passionate about XR's potential and see opportunities for collaboration, <a href="mailto:alexis@syry.io" style="text-decoration: none;"><strong>let's connect!</strong></a></p>
